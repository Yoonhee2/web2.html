<br>Make this warm, soothing bowl of rice cake soup with dumplings for your New Year celebration! It’s also a great comfort food any time of year. The recipe shows how to make a quick Korean beef broth, but use any broth/stock you prefer.

<p>Although we eat tteokguk all year round, tteokguk is a traditional New Year dish. I already have two versions of tteokguk on the blog – tteokguk and gul tteokguk (oyster rice cake). This time, I’m showing you how to make a variation made with mandu (Korean dumplings), hence the name tteok mandu guk (떡만두국)!</p>
<br>My previous tteokguk recipe uses beef brisket which is flavorful but takes a long time to cook. In this recipe, I used a quick method to make a beef soup base. You can also use anchovy broth, vegetable broth or even store-bought chicken stock, if preferred.
<p>For dumplings, I personally prefer kimchi mandu for the soup. The robust flavor and crunchy texture of kimchi mandu add a nice contrast to the mildly flavored broth and soft rice cake slices. You can, of course, use any dumplings, including your favorite store bought ones.</p1>
